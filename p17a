Initialize a variable 'count' to 0.
Read the array size, 'n'.
Declare an integer array of size 'n'.
Read the array elements.
Loop through each element of the array from index 0 to n-2: a. Loop through the remaining elements of the array from index i+1 to n-1: i. If the current element and any of the remaining elements are equal, increment the 'count' variable and break out of the inner loop.
Print the value of 'count' as the total number of duplicate elements in the array.
